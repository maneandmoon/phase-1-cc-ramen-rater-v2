//If you put your <script> at the bottom of the body, you don't need to listen 
//for DOMContentLoaded, the DOM will already be loaded at that point. You need 
//DOMContentLoaded when your <script> is in the <head> element, which was commonly 
//recommended long ago, or in the middle of the <body> somewhere.

//remember to add defer?
//to end of <body>
// <script defer type="module" src="./src/index.js"></script>

//from the `ramen-menu` div, and should not be displayed in the `ramen-detail`
